# HydroCred: A Data-Driven Green Hydrogen Ledger

HydroCred is an innovative project aimed at accelerating the transition to clean energy through a transparent and automated **Hydrogen Credit System (HCS)**. This repository documents the complete project journey, from foundational data analysis to a functional prototype and a production-ready application vision.

-----

## Repository Structure & Project Versions

This repository contains two primary components: the official project submission and the full-scale production application.

### **Part A: The Functional Prototype (Official Submission)**

This is the official submission for the project, designed to meet the `.ipynb` requirement. It's a self-contained, interactive application that demonstrates the core blockchain logic.

  * **File Location:** [`https://github.com/shahmoksheet/sustainable-energy/blob/main/final_sustainable_energy.ipynb`]
  * **Technology:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Google Colab

#### **How to Run the Prototype:**

1.  **Open the `.ipynb` file** in Google Colaboratory.
2.  **Upload the Dataset:** If prompted, upload the `global-data-on-sustainable-energy (1).csv` file to the Colab session.
3.  **Run the Cells:** Execute the notebook cells sequentially from top to bottom.
4.  **Click the Live Demo Link:** The final cell will generate a unique, temporary `ngrok` URL. Click this link to open and interact with the live application.

-----

### **Part B: The Production-Ready Application**

This is the full-scale version of HydroCred, built with a modern, scalable web stack. The professional user interface and architecture shown in our presentation are from this version.

  * **File Location:** `https://github.com/shahmoksheet/Hydrocred`
  * **Technology:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, designed for Polygon (Blockchain)

#### **How to Run Locally:**

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js and `npm` installed.
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## The Project Journey: A Multi-Week Methodology

Our project followed a structured, multi-week journey to ensure our solution was both technically sound and grounded in real-world data.

### **Week 1: Conceptual Framework**

  * **Objective:** Establish the conceptual framework for a Hierarchical Green Hydrogen Credit System (HCS).
  * **Key Actions:**
      * Defined the problem of lacking standardized mechanisms to incentivize the hydrogen economy.
      * Designed a multi-tier credit architecture: `Producers → Distributors → Consumers`.
      * Created a high-level workflow for credit issuance, tracking, and redemption.

### **Week 2: Foundational Data Analysis**

  * **Objective:** Perform a data-driven comparative study of global renewable energy adoption (2000–2020) to identify trends and justify the focus on hydrogen.
  * **Key Analyses Performed:**
      * **Trend Visualization:** Charted global electricity generation by source over two decades.
      * **Country Comparison:** Analyzed growth in renewable energy across major economies like China, the USA, and India.
      * **Correlation Study:** Examined the relationship between renewable share, GDP per capita, and access to electricity.
  * **Key Insight:** Our analysis confirmed that while renewable adoption is growing, hydrogen's unique properties (energy density, storage) make it the critical missing piece for deep decarbonization.

### **Week 3: The Functional Prototype & Vision**

  * **Objective:** Bring the concept to life by building a functional prototype and designing a scalable, production-ready vision.
  * **Key Actions:**
      * Developed the interactive **Python/Streamlit prototype** to prove the core blockchain and transaction logic.
      * Architected and designed the **full-scale React/Node.js application** to demonstrate a clear roadmap for real-world deployment.
