# HydroCred – Towards a Data-Driven Green Hydrogen Future

## **Overview**
HydroCred is an innovative project aimed at accelerating the transition to clean energy through a **Hydrogen Credit System (HCS)**.  
This repository documents the research, analysis, and development journey in a **multi-week roadmap**, leading to a robust model that evaluates renewable energy trends and sets the stage for hydrogen adoption strategies.

---

## **Week 1 – Foundation & Hydrogen Credit Concept**
- **Objective:** Establish a conceptual framework for a **Hierarchical Green Hydrogen Credit System**.
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Defined the problem statement: lack of standardized mechanisms to incentivize hydrogen-based energy production and consumption.
  - Designed a **multi-tier credit architecture**:
    - Producers → Distributors → Consumers
  - Created a **high-level workflow** for credit issuance, tracking, and redemption.
- **Impact:** Laid the groundwork for a scalable hydrogen economy model.

## **Week 2 – Global Renewable Energy Data Analysis**
- **Objective:** Perform a **data-driven comparative study** of global renewable energy adoption (2000–2020) to assess current progress and gaps.
- **Dataset Used:**  
  [`global-data-on-sustainable-energy.csv`](./global-data-on-sustainable-energy.csv)  
  (Includes renewable electricity share, generation, GDP per capita, access to electricity, etc.)

### **Key Analyses**
1. **Trend Visualization:**  
   - Stacked area chart of electricity generation by source (renewables, fossil fuels, nuclear).
2. **Country Comparison:**  
   - Analyzed six major economies: **China, USA, India, Germany, Brazil, Japan**.
   - Measured absolute growth in renewable electricity (2000–2020).
3. **Correlation Study:**  
   - Examined relationships between renewable share and:
     - GDP per capita
     - Access to electricity
     - Renewable capacity per capita
4. **Findings:**
   - China dominates absolute growth, followed by USA and Germany.
   - Higher GDP correlates with faster renewable adoption.
   - Developing nations show upward trends but face infrastructure challenges.

### **Key Insights**
- Economic capacity and policy interventions are pivotal for renewable success.
- Hydrogen emerges as a strong candidate to bridge existing gaps in storage, scalability, and decarbonization.

## **Planned Week 3 – Hydrogen Energy Modelling**
- Build a **predictive model** to forecast renewable energy and hydrogen adoption potential using:
  - Machine Learning (Python, scikit-learn)
  - Historical and socio-economic indicators
- Integrate Week 1’s **Hydrogen Credit System** with Week 2’s **data-driven foundation**.
